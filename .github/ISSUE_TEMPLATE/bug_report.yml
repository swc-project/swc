        If swc crashed or panicked, you can gain error message by running `swc --sync <input.js>`.
        Also, you can get backtrace by invoking swc by setting an environment variable `SWC_DEBUG` to `1`.

        Note that if you do not provide a minimal reproduction, the issue will be closed because the team cannot work on it.
        Please read https://antfu.me/posts/why-reproductions-are-required for details.
