/**
 * Executing hooks requires complex logic as we need to deal with 2 constraints.
 *
 * 1. Init hooks (ngOnInit, ngAfterContentInit, ngAfterViewInit) must all be executed once and only
 * once, across many change detection cycles. This must be true even if some hooks throw, or if
 * some recursively trigger a change detection cycle.
 * To solve that, it is required to track the state of the execution of these init hooks.
 * This is done by storing and maintaining flags in the view: the {@link InitPhaseState},
 * and the index within that phase. They can be seen as a cursor in the following structure:
 * [[onInit1, onInit2], [afterContentInit1], [afterViewInit1, afterViewInit2, afterViewInit3]]
 * They are are stored as flags in LView[FLAGS].
 *
 * 2. Pre-order hooks can be executed in batches, because of the select instruction.
 * To be able to pause and resume their execution, we also need some state about the hook's array
 * that is being processed:
 * - the index of the next hook to be executed
 * - the number of init hooks already found in the processed part of the  array
 * They are are stored as flags in LView[PREORDER_HOOK_FLAGS].
