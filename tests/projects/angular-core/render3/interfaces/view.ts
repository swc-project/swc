  /**
   * Points to the declaration component view, used to track transplanted `LView`s.
   *
   * See: `DECLARATION_VIEW` which points to the actual `LView` where it was declared, whereas
   * `DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW` points to the component which may not be same as
   * `DECLARATION_VIEW`.
   *
   * Example:
   * ```
   * <#VIEW #myComp>
   *  <div *ngIf="true">
   *   <ng-template #myTmpl>...</ng-template>
   *  </div>
   * </#VIEW>
   * ```
   * In the above case `DECLARATION_VIEW` for `myTmpl` points to the `LView` of `ngIf` whereas
   * `DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW` points to `LView` of the `myComp` which owns the template.
   *
   * The reason for this is that all embedded views are always check-always whereas the component
   * view can be check-always or on-push. When we have a transplanted view it is important to
   * determine if we have transplanted a view from check-always declaration to on-push insertion
   * point. In such a case the transplanted view needs to be added to the `LContainer` in the
   * declared `LView` and CD during the declared view CD (in addition to the CD at the insertion
   * point.) (Any transplanted views which are intra Component are of no interest because the CD
   * strategy of declaration and insertion will always be the same, because it is the same
   * component.)
   *
   * Queries already track moved views in `LView[DECLARATION_LCONTAINER]` and
   * `LContainer[MOVED_VIEWS]`. However the queries also track `LView`s which moved within the same
   * component `LView`. Transplanted views are a subset of moved views, and we use
   * `DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW` to differentiate them. As in this example.
   *
   * Example showing intra component `LView` movement.
   * ```
   * <#VIEW #myComp>
   *   <div *ngIf="condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock"></div>
   *   <ng-template #thenBlock>Content to render when condition is true.</ng-template>
   *   <ng-template #elseBlock>Content to render when condition is false.</ng-template>
   * </#VIEW>
   * ```
   * The `thenBlock` and `elseBlock` is moved but not transplanted.
   *
   * Example showing inter component `LView` movement (transplanted view).
   * ```
   * <#VIEW #myComp>
   *   <ng-template #myTmpl>...</ng-template>
   *   <insertion-component [template]="myTmpl"></insertion-component>
   * </#VIEW>
   * ```
   * In the above example `myTmpl` is passed into a different component. If `insertion-component`
   * instantiates `myTmpl` and `insertion-component` is on-push then the `LContainer` needs to be
   * marked as containing transplanted views and those views need to be CD as part of the
   * declaration CD.
   *
   *
   * When change detection runs, it iterates over `[MOVED_VIEWS]` and CDs any child `LView`s where
   * the `DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW` of the current component and the child `LView` does not match
   * (it has been transplanted across components.)
   *
   * Note: `[DECLARATION_COMPONENT_VIEW]` points to itself if the LView is a component view (the
   *       simplest / most common case).
   *
   * see also:
   *   - https://hackmd.io/@mhevery/rJUJsvv9H write up of the problem
   *   - `LContainer[ACTIVE_INDEX]` for flag which marks which `LContainer` has transplanted views.
