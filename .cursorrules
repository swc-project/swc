1. You should write performant code. Always prefer performance over other things.
2. Always write comments in English.
3. Do not use unstable, nightly only features.
4. When creating Atom instances, it's better to use Cow<str> or &str instead of String. Note that `&str` is better than `Cow<str>` here.
