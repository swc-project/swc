# Architectural Decision Records

This directory contains a series of [Architectural Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/)
or "ADRs" for the `swc` project. We're going to try to use it as a kind of collective
memory of the decisions we've made and the path we've taken to get the project to its current
point.

Note that these are *historical references* that do not supersede (but might enhance) the living
documentation of the project itself, which you can find inline in the source code.

Proposing a non-trivial change to the way `swc` works? You might like to start with an ADR
by copying `template.md` into a new file, filling out a first version of the proposal, and
posting it as a PR on the github repo for discussion.
