//! Bindings to acquire a global named lock.
//!
//! This is intended to be used to synchronize multiple compiler processes to
//! ensure that we can output complete errors without interleaving on Windows.
//! Note that this is currently only needed for allowing only one 32-bit MSVC
//! linker to execute at once on MSVC hosts, so this is only implemented for
//! `cfg(windows)`. Also note that this may not always be used on Windows,
//! only when targeting 32-bit MSVC.
//!
//! For more information about why this is necessary, see where this is called.
