|   <!--  In this first case we put the ]] at the end of the first CDATA block
         and the > in the second CDATA block  -->

    Since this is a CDATA section
    I can use all sorts of reserved characters
    like > < " and &
    or write things like
    <foo></bar>
    but my document is still well formed!
