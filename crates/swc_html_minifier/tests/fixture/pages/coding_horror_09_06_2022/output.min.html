If you knew the right commands, you could type them in to load programs from cassette tape. But that was an expensive add-on option with early personal computers. For many of us, if we wanted the computer to do anything, we had to type in entire programs from books like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games>101 Basic Computer Games</a>, by hand... <a href="https://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=2">like so</a>.<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2022/01/image-2.png class=kg-image alt loading=lazy width=784 height=1049 srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/image-2.png 600w,https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2022/01/image-2.png 784w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Yep, believe it or not, circa 1983, <em>this was our idea of a good time</em>. No, we didn't get out much. The book itself was a sort of greatest hits compilation of games collected from Ahl's seminal <a href=https://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n11/66_Dave_tells_Ahl__the_hist.php>Creative Computing magazine in the 1970s</a>:<blockquote>As soon as Ahl made up his mind to leave DEC, he started laying the groundwork for Creative Computing. He announced intentions to publish the magazine at NCC in June 1974 and over the next few months contacted prospective authors, got mailing lists, arranged for typesetting and printing, and started organizing hundreds of other details.<br><br>In addition, he also moved his family to Morristown, NJ, and settled into his new job at AT&T. He had little spare capital, so he substituted for it with "sweat equity." He edited submitted articles and wrote others. He specified type, took photos, got books of "clip art," drew illustrations, and laid out boards. He wrote and laid out circulation flyers, pasted on labels, sorted and bundled mailings.<br><br>By October 1974, when it was time to specify the first print run, he had just 600 subscribers. But Ahl had no intention of running off just 600 issues. He took all the money he had received, divided it in half, and printed 8000 copies with it. These rolled off the presses October 31, 1974. Ahl recounts the feeling of euphoria on the drive to the printer replaced by dismay when he saw two skids of magazines and wondered how he would ever get them off the premises. Three trips later, his basement and garage were filled with 320 bundles of 25 magazines each. He delivered the 600 subscriber copies to the post office the next day, but it took nearly three weeks to paste labels by hand onto the other 7400 copies and send them, unsolicited, to libraries and school systems throughout the country.</blockquote><p>I also <a href=https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-best-of-creative-computing/>loved Creative Computing</a>, but it was a little before my time:<ul><li>1971 ‚Äì Ahl ports the programs from FOCAL to BASIC.<li>1973 ‚Äì <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games>101 BASIC Computer Games</a> is first published by DEC.<li>1974 ‚Äì Ahl founds <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Computing_(magazine)>Creative Computing</a> magazine and acquires the rights to the book from DEC.<li>1977 ‚Äì the ‚Äútrinity‚Äù of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II>Apple II</a> üñ•Ô∏è, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET>PET </a> Ô∏èüñ•Ô∏è, and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80>TRS-80 </a> üñ•Ô∏è microcomputers are released to the public, all with BASIC built in, at prices regular people could mostly afford üôå<li>1978 ‚Äì a second edition of BASIC Computer Games is released, this time published by Ahl himself.</ul><p>As you can see, there‚Äôs no way average people in 1973-1976 were doing a whole lot with BASIC programs, as <em>they had no microcomputers capable of running BASIC to buy! </em>It took a while for inexpensive personal computers to trickle down to the mainstream, which brings us to roughly 1984 when the sequels started appearing.<p>There was a <a href=https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/16765.basic-computer-games-small-basic-edition.aspx>half-hearted attempt to modernize these early BASIC programs in 2010 with SmallBasic</a>, but I didn't feel these ports did much to bring the code up to date, and overall had little relevance to modern code practices. You can compare <a href=https://pastebin.com/j4jzGd4V>the original 1973 BASIC Civil War</a> with <a href=https://pastebin.com/5q1B0t2C>the 2010 SmallBasic port</a> to see what I mean:<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2022/01/image-3.png class=kg-image alt loading=lazy width=2000 height=1083 srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/image-3.png 600w,https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/image-3.png 1000w,https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/image-3.png 1600w,https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w2400/2022/01/image-3.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Certainly we can do a bit better than merely removing the line numbers?

It's hard to understate <a href=https://time.com/69316/basic/>how important this book was to an entire generation of programmers</a>. At one point, <strong>there were more copies of this book in print than there were personal computers, period!</strong><blockquote>... in 1973, DEC published an anthology, <em>101 BASIC Computer Games</em>. The book quickly went into a second printing, for a total of 10,000 copies sold. ‚ÄúThat was far more books than there were computers around, so people were buying three, four, five of them for each computer.‚Äù</blockquote><p>It went on to be the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games#Reception>first computer book to sell a million copies</a>. Quite a legacy.<p>I think we owe it to the world to bring this book up to date using <strong>modern, memory safe languages that embody the original spirit of BASIC, </strong>and modern programming practices including subroutines.<p>So let's do this. <strong>Please <a href=https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games>join us on GitHub</a></strong>, where we're updating those original 101 BASIC games in 10 memory safe, general purpose scripting languages:<ul><li>Java / Kotlin<li>Python<li>C#<li>VB.NET<li>JavaScript<li>Ruby<li>Perl<li>Lua</ul><p>(Edit: as of March 2022, we've a) offered Kotlin as an alternative to Java, b) removed Pascal since we can't guarantee memory safety there, and replaced it with Rust, which very much can, and c) added Lua which <em>just</em> cracked the top 20 in TIOBE and strongly meets the scripting and memory safe criteria.)<p>Now, bear in mind these are <em>very</em> primitive games from the 1970s. They aren't going to win any awards for gameplay, or programming sophistication. But they <em>are </em><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_mainframe_games>precious artifacts of early computing</a> that deserve to be preserved for future generations, including the wonderful <a href=http://www.bekerbots.com/botbooks.htm>original art by George Beker</a>.<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2022/01/Chomperanimated2.gif class=kg-image alt loading=lazy width=300 height=318></figure><p><strong>We need your help to do this right</strong>, and <em>collaboratively together</em>, as with all modern programming projects.

About 50% more volume for considerably more than 2√ó the power isn't a bad deal!)<p>I chose the Streacom DA2 as my personal build, because after experimenting heavily with the DAN A4 SFX, I realized you need more room to deal with extremely powerful CPUs and GPUs in this form factor, and I wanted a truly powerful system:<ul><li>Intel <a href=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/processors/core/i9-processors/i9-9900ks.html>i9-9900KS</a> (8 core, 16 thread, 5.0 GHz) CPU <li>Samsung 970 PRO 1TB / Samsung 970 EVO 2TB / Samsung 860 QVO 4TB SATA<li>64GB DDR4-3000<li><a href=http://www.cryorig.com/h7.php>Cryorig H7</a> cooler (exact fit)<li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU</ul><p>Compared to my old 2015-2017 system, a slightly overclocked i7-7700k, that at least gives me 2√ó the cores (and faster cores, both in clock rate and IPC), 2√ó the memory, and 2√ó the M.2 slots (two versus one).<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2020/04/streacom-da2-9900ks-stats.png class=kg-image alt loading=lazy></figure><p>The DA2 is a clever case though less perfect than the A4-SFX. What's neat about it is the hybrid open-air design (on the top and bottom) plus the versatile horizontal and vertical bracket system interior.

You'll note that the front of the DA2 is totally solid, no air holes, so you do need that extra airflow.<p>I only have a few criticisms of this Streacom DA2 case:<ul><li>The side panels are tool free, which is excellent, but the pressure fit makes them fairly difficult to remove. Feels like this could be tweaked?<li>(Don't even think about using a full sized ATX power supply. In theory it is supported, but the build becomes so much more difficult. Use a SFX power supply, which you'd expect to do for a mini-ITX build anyway.)<li>My primary complaint is that the <strong>power extension cable gets in the way</strong>. I had to remove it and re-attach it during my build. They should custom route the power cable upwards so it blocks less stuff.<li>Less of a criticism and more of an observation: if your build uses a powerful GPU and CPU, you'll need two case fans. There's mounting points for a 92mm fan in the rear, and the bracket system makes it easy to mount a 140mm fan blowing inward. You will definitely need both fans!</ul><p>Here's the configuration I recommend, open on both the top and bottom for maximum airflow, with three fans total:<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2020/04/streacom-da2-fan-config.jpg class=kg-image alt loading=lazy></figure><p>If you are a water cooling kind of person ‚Äì I am definitely not, I experienced one too many traumatic cooling fluid leaks in the early 2000s ‚Äì then you will use that 140mm space for the radiator.<p>I have definitely <a href=https://blog.codinghorror.com/is-your-computer-stable/>burn-in tested this machine</a>, as I do all systems I build, and it passed with flying colors. But to be honest, if you expect to be under full CPU and GPU loads for extended periods of time you <em>might</em> need to switch to water cooling due to the space constraints. (Or pick slightly less powerful components.)<p>If you haven't built a PC system recently, it's easier than it has ever been.

If electric car prices are decreasing, battery costs <em>must</em> be decreasing, because it's not like the cost of fabricating rubber, aluminum, glass, and steel into car shapes can decline that much, right?</p> <p><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/09/ev-battery-costs.png alt=ev-battery-costs loading=lazy></p> <p>On an <em>electric scooter</em>, though, the effect of battery price has to be even more dramatic because scooters are such <a href=https://blog.codinghorror.com/geek-transportation-systems/>lightweight, compact, and simple machines</a>. They aren't much more than a battery and an electric motor to begin with. Remember the <a href=https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Sebastopol-s-Zap-Power-Systems-is-banking-on-3067718.php>the Zappy electric scooter</a> from twenty years ago?</p> <p><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/09/zappy-electric-scooter-year-2000.jpg alt=zappy-electric-scooter-year-2000 loading=lazy></p> <p>What killed the electric scooter back then is the same thing that <a href=https://blog.codinghorror.com/electric-geek-transportation-systems/>killed the electric car</a> of year 2000: terrible lead-acid battery technology. It's too heavy, it lacks power, it doesn't have enough range, it takes too long to charge. These are all different ways of saying the same thing: <em>the battery sucks</em>. It wasn't until Lithium Ion batteries matured that both the electric car and the electric scooter ‚Äî and pretty much electric <em>everything</em>, if you think about it ‚Äî became viable.</p> <p>Thus, one way to see if Lithium Ion battery prices are indeed generally dropping independent of all other manufacturing concerns is to examine the cost of electric scooters over the last few years. Let's consider one of the most popular models, the Xiaomi Mi M365:</p> <p><a href=https://camelcamelcamel.com/Xiaomi-Electric-Long-range-Fold-n-Carry-Ultra-Lightweight/product/B076KKX4BC><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/09/xiaomi-mi-m365-price-history-2018-2019.png alt=xiaomi-mi-m365-price-history-2018-2019 loading=lazy></a></p> <p>This graph only shows roughly two years, from January 2018 to now; it looks like the original price for the Xiaomi M365 when it hit the US market in early 2017 was around $800. So <strong>the price of a popular, common electric scooter has <em>halved</em> in three years.</strong> Very good news indeed for electric vehicles of all types!</p> <p>This dramatic drop in electric scooter price from 2016 to 2019 may not be surprising versus the parallel rise of the quasi-legal electric scooter smartphone app rental industry over roughly the same time period, in the form of Bird, Lime, Skip, Spin, Scoot, etc.</p> <p><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/09/electric-scooter-rentals-bird-lime.jpg alt=electric-scooter-rentals-bird-lime loading=lazy></p> <p>Early versions of Bird scooters were <em>actual Xiaomi M365s</em>, slightly modified for rental. Only by late 2018 had they <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_(company)#Vehicles>migrated to</a> custom built, ruggedized scooters optimized for the rental market. The rental industries <a href=https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-bird-scooters-money-profit-strategy-20190505-story.html>have their own challenges</a>, and ironically have started to pivot to monthly rentals rather than the classic 15 cents per minute.</p> <blockquote> <p>Bird has experimented with its business model in recent months. In early March, the company altered its repair program in Los Angeles, which had relied on gig workers to fix broken scooters. It moved repairs in-house (though scooters are still charged each night by an army of gig workers). Later that month, the company introduced scooters with locks in some markets, in a bid to prevent theft and vandalism.</p> <p>In April, it announced the launch of a more traditional rental program in San Francisco and Barcelona, in which users could pay $25 per month to rent a Xiaomi m365 from the company rather than paying per ride.</p> </blockquote> <p>But this isn't meant to be a blog entry about the viability of scooter rental company business models.</p> <p>I want to tackle a more fundamental question: <strong>are electric scooters the future of transportation?</strong></p> <p>Even Uber, as screwed up of a company as they still are, knows cars are overkill for a lot of basic transportation needs:</p> <blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr>Uber believes their current micro fleet of ebikes and scooters can displace trips under 3 miles.<br><br>46% of Uber's rides are under 3 miles üëÄ <a href=https://t.co/OFmb8arZ3j>pic.twitter.com/OFmb8arZ3j</a></p>‚Äî Micromobility Industries (@MicromobilityCo) <a href="https://twitter.com/MicromobilityCo/status/1116703423108227072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js charset=utf-8></script> <p>We have plenty of scooters here at my house, and the family and I enjoy them greatly, but I have never actually ridden or owned an electric scooter. So I bought one. It is of course the popular, inexpensive, and well reviewed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076KKX4BC/?tag=codihorr-20">Xiaomi Mi M365</a>.</p> <p><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/08/m365-scooter.jpg alt=m365-scooter loading=lazy></p> <p>Here's a picture of my electric scooter inside <a href=https://blog.codinghorror.com/electric-geek-transportation-systems/>my electric car</a>. (I apologize that I didn't have an electric bicycle to park next to it for maximum smugness, but you can <em>bet your sweet electrons</em> I'll work on that next!)</p> <p><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/09/electric-scooter-in-electric-car.jpg alt=electric-scooter-in-electric-car loading=lazy></p> <p>The short version of my review is <strong>this electric scooter is incredibly fun, works great, and if you can get it for a price around $300, practically a no-brainer.</strong> I love it, my kids love it, and as long as you're <a href=https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/11/2/18053650/elon-musk-electric-scooters-dignity-recode-swisher>conceptually OK with the look, unlike Elon Musk</a> üõ¥üí® then you'll probably love it too.</p> <iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0JgCn8-aETA frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>I found a neat video covering the "one year later" experience of owning the scooter, and what you might eventually run into or want to tweak.</p> <iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LyzdSktRfVI frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>(The main thing to take away from this video is that flats <em>super suck</em> on tires this small, so be warned. I put Slime in my Mi's tires out of an abundance of caution, but you could also go with solid tubeless tires ‚Äì at the cost of some ride comfort ‚Äì if you're really worried.)</p> <p>That's not to say that the electric scooter experience is perfect. There are some challenges with electric scooters, starting with the biggest one: <a href=https://www.techradar.com/news/are-electric-scooters-legal-know-the-law-where-you-live>your local government has no idea how to regulate the darn things</a>.</p> <ul> <li>Is this regulated like a bicycle? If not, why not?</li> <li>Are they allowed on the sidewalk?</li> <li>Do you have to ride them in the road, with cars ‚Ä¶ uh, depending on the speed limit?</li> <li>Do you need a driver's license?</li> <li>Do you need a helmet?</li> <li>Are you even <em>allowed</em> to legally ride them in public at all outside of private property?</li> </ul> <p>The answers also vary wildly depending on where you live, and with no consistency or apparent logic. Here are <a href=https://bayareabicyclelaw.com/new-e-scooter-laws-2019/>the current electric scooter laws in California</a>, for what it's worth, which <em>require the rider to have a valid driver's license</em> (unlike electric bicycles) and also disallow them from sidewalks, both of which I feel are onerous and unnecessary restrictions.</p> <p>One aspect of those laws I <em>definitely</em> agree with, however, is the <strong>15 mile per hour speed restriction</strong>. That's a plenty brisk top speed for a standing adult with no special safety equipment. Anything faster starts to get decidedly ‚Ä¶ uncomfortable. Consider <a href=https://www.ewheels.com/product/new-turbowheel-lightning-957wh-battery-2x-1000w-3600w-motors/>this monster of a 1165KWh electric scooter</a>, with dual motors and dual suspension that goes up to <em>forty freakin' miles per hour</em>.</p> <iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/z6O7KmJQbJE frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>That ‚Ä¶ is ‚Ä¶ terrifying. Even the reviewer, in full motorcycle safety gear, wasn't willing to push it all the way to 40 MPH. And I don't blame him! But now that I've shown you the undisputed Honda Civic everyman budget model of electric scooter in the M365, hopefully this gives you a taste of the wider emerging diversity in these kinds of minimalistic electric vehicles. If you want a <a href="https://www.unagiscooters.com/products/the-scooter?variant=15012683448435">luxury</a> electric scooter, an <a href=https://fluidfreeride.com/products/mosquito-lightweight-foldable-electric-scooter>ultralight</a> electric scooter, a <a href=https://electrek.co/2019/06/10/widewheel-electric-scooter-off-road-test/>rugged offroad</a> electric scooter ‚Ä¶ all things are possible, for a price.</p> <p>Another reason the M365 is available for so cheap is that is successor, the <a href=https://www.mi.com/global/mi-electric-scooter-pro/>Xiaomi M365 Pro</a>, was recently released, although it is not quite possible to obtain in the US at the moment.</p> <iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1i6g-la23HE frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>Having ridden my M365 a fair bit, I can confirm all the Pro improvements are welcome, if incremental: bigger battery and disc brake, more power, better display, improved latch mechanism, etc.</p> <p><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/09/xiaomi-mi-m365-vs-pro.jpg alt=xiaomi-mi-m365-vs-pro loading=lazy></p> <p>None of those Pro improvements, however, are worth a 2√ó increase in price so I'd recommend sticking with the M365 for now because its value proposition is off the charts. Did I mention there's a bluetooth connection, and an app, and it is possible to <a href=https://www.gearbest.com/blog/how-to/how-to-install-xiaomi-m365-electric-scooter-firmware-mod-6635>hack the M365 firmware</a>? Pretty cool how electric vehicles are inherently digital, isn't it?</p> <p>Here are a few other observations after riding my M365 around a fair bit:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Please be respectful around pedestrians.</strong> Most of the sidewalks around here are not busy at all, but the pedestrians I encountered on the electric scooter were definitely more freaked out than I‚Äôve seen before when using regular kick scooters (or skateboards) on the sidewalk, which did surprise me. An electric scooter has more heft to it, both physically at 26 pounds, and in the 15 mile per hour speed it can reach ‚Äì but also mentally in terms of how it looks and how people approach it. I recommend slowing down to just above walking speed when encountering pedestrians, and if there is a bike lane available, I'd definitely recommend using that.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Hills work great.</strong> The kryptonite of traditional kick scooters is hills, and I'm pleased to report that even with a <small>cough</small> sizable adult such as myself riding, I was able to sustain a respectable above-walking speed on most <em>reasonable</em> hills. Where I looked at a hill and thought "this probably should work", it did. That's impressive, considering this <em>isn't</em> the upgraded Pro model with bigger battery and more powerful motor. On flats and downhills the performance is superb, as you'd expect. That said, if you are a really big or tall adult, or live in a particularly hilly area, wait for the Pro model or an equivalent.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Portability is good, but borderline.</strong> At ~26 pounds, the electric scooter is reasonably portable, but it's not something you a) could really get away with taking inside a restaurant / store with you to prevent theft or b) want to be carrying around on your person for any significant length of time. It's not nearly as nimble or portable as a kick scooter, but that's a high bar. You'll need to carry a bike lock and think about how to lock your scooter on bike racks, which turned out to be ‚Ä¶ more geometrically challenging than I anticipated due to the small tires, disc brakes, and the engine in the front wheel. They need more obvious locking points on the chassis.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To be honest with you I'm still bitter about the whole <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway_Inc.>Segway</a> debacle. There was so much hype back in the day. That ridiculous thing was <a href=https://www.wired.com/2009/12/1203segway-unveiled/>supposed to change the world</a>. Instead, we got ‚Ä¶ <em>Paul Blart Mall Cop</em>.</p> <p><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/09/paul-blart-segway.jpeg alt=paul-blart-segway loading=lazy></p> <p>A Segway was $5,000 at launch in 2001, which is a whopping $7,248 in inflation adjusted dollars. Here in 2019, cheap $200 to $300 electric scooters are basically the transformational technology the Segway was <em>supposed</em> to be, aren't they? Are electric scooters the future of (most) transportation? I'm not sure, but I do like where we're headed, even if it took us twenty years to get there.</p>  <b><a href=//blog.codinghorror.com/the-rise-of-the-electric-scooter/#discourse-comments>Discussion</a></b> </section> </article> <article class="no-image post"> <header class=post-header> <span class=post-meta><time datetime=2019-08-20>20 Aug 2019</time> </span> <h2 class=post-title><a href=/electric-geek-transportation-systems/>Electric Geek Transportation Systems</a></h2> </header> <section class=post-content> <p>I've never thought of myself as a "car person".

Even for a person who has basically zero interest in automobiles, it did sound <em>really cool</em>.</p> <p><a href=https://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla_model_s><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/08/oatmeal-tesla-s-spaceboat.jpg alt=oatmeal-tesla-s-spaceboat loading=lazy></a></p> <p>It's been 5 years, but from time to time I'd see some electric vehicle on the road and I'd think about that <strong>Intergalactic SpaceBoat of Light and Wonder</strong>. Maybe it's time for our family to jump on the electric car trend, too, and just late enough that we can avoid the bleeding edge and end up merely on the ‚Ä¶ <em>leading</em> edge?</p> <p>That's why we're now the proud owners of a <a href=https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a26144426/2019-kia-niro-ev-driven/>fully electric 2019 Kia Niro</a>.</p> <p><a href=https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a26144426/2019-kia-niro-ev-driven/><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/08/kia-niro-2019.jpg alt=kia-niro-2019 loading=lazy></a></p> <p>I've somehow gone from being a person who basically doesn't care about cars at all ‚Ä¶ to being <strong>one of those insufferable electric car people who won't shut up about them</strong>. I apologize in advance. If you suddenly feel an overwhelming urge to close this browser tab, I don't blame you.</p> <p>I was expecting another car, like the three we bought before. What I got, instead, was a transformation:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Yes, yes, electric cars are clean, but it's a revelation how clean <em>everything</em> is in an electric. You take for granted how dirty and noisy gas based cars are in daily operation ‚Äì the engine noise, the exhaust fumes, the brake dust on the rims, the oily residues and thin black film that descends on everything, the way you have to wash your hands every time you use the gas station pumps. You don't fully appreciate how oppressive those little dirty details were until they're gone.</p> </li> <li> <p>Electric cars are (almost) completely silent. I guess technically in 2019 electric cars require artificial soundmakers at low speed for safety, and this car has one. But The Oatmeal was right. Electric cars <em>feel</em> like spacecraft because they move so effortlessly. There's virtually no delay from action to reaction, near immediate acceleration and deceleration ‚Ä¶ with almost no sound or vibration at all, like you're in freakin' space! It's so immensely satisfying!</p> </li> <li> <p>Electric cars aren't just <em>electric</em>, they're utterly digital to their very core. Gas cars always felt like the classic 1950s Pixar Cars world of grease monkeys and machine shop guys, maybe with a few digital bobbins added here and there as an afterthought. This electric car, on the other hand, is squarely in the post-iPhone world of everyday digital gadgets. It feels more like a giant smartphone than a car. I am a programmer, I'm a digital guy, I love digital stuff. And electric cars are part of <em>my</em> world, rather than the other way around. It feels good.</p> </li> <li> <p>Electric cars are mechanically much simpler than gasoline cars, which means they are inherently more reliable and cheaper to maintain. An internal combustion engine has hundreds of moving parts, many of which require regular maintenance, fluids, filters, and tune ups. It also has a complex transmission to translate the narrow power band of a gas powered engine. None of this is necessary on an electric vehicle, whose electric motor is basically one moving part with simple 100% direct drive from the motor to the wheels. This newfound simplicity is deeply appealing to a guy who always saw cars as incredibly complicated (but computers, not so much).</p> </li> <li> <p>Being able to charge at home overnight is perhaps the most radical transformation of all. Your house is now a "gas station". Our Kia Niro has a range of about <strong>250 miles</strong> on a full battery. With any modern electric car, provided you drive less than 200 miles a day round trip (who even drives this much?), it's very unlikely you'll ever need to "fill the tank" anywhere but at home. Ever. It's so strange to think that in 50 years, gas stations <a href=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/As-EVs-threaten-gas-stations-owners-turn-to-14291843.php>may eventually be as odd to see in public as telephone booths now are</a>. Our charger is, conveniently enough, right next to the driveway since that's where the power breaker box was. With the level 2 charger installed, it literally <em>looks</em> like a gas pump on the side of the house, except this one "pumps" ‚Ä¶ electrons.</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/08/level-2-ev-charger.jpg alt=level-2-ev-charger loading=lazy></p> <p>This electric car is such a great experience. It's so much better than our gas powered station wagon that I swear, if there was a fully electric minivan (there isn't) I would literally sell our Honda minivan <em>tomorrow</em> and switch over. Without question. And believe me, I had no plans to sell that vehicle two months ago. The electric car is <em>that much better</em>.</p> <p>I was expecting "yet another car", but what I got instead was a new, radical worldview. Driving a car powered by barely controlled liquid fuel detonations used to be normal. But in an world of more and more viable electric vehicles this status quo increasingly starts to feel ‚Ä¶ deeply unnatural. Electric is so much better of an overall experience that you begin to wonder: why did we <em>ever</em> do it that way?</p> <p>Gas cars seem, for lack of a better word, <a href=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-ev-oil-crisis/><em>obsolete</em>.</a></p> <p><a href=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-ev-oil-crisis/><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/08/ev-sales.jpg alt=ev-sales loading=lazy></a></p> <p>How did this transformation happen, from my perspective, so suddenly? When exactly did electric cars go from "expensive, experimental thing for crazy people" to "By God, I'll never buy another old fashioned gasoline based car if I can help it"?</p> <p>I was vaguely aware of the early electric cars. I even remember one coworker circa 2001 who owned a bright neon green Honda Insight. I ignored it all because, like I said, <em>I'm not a car guy</em>. I needed to do the research to understand the history, and I started with the often recommended documentary <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F>Who Killed the Electric Car?</a></p> <iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-sc-NxP6mmI frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>This is mostly about the original highly experimental <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_EV1>General Motors EV1</a> from 1996 to 1999. It's so early the first models had lead-acid batteries! üò± There's a number of conspiracy theories floated in the video, but I think the simple answer to the implied question in the title is straight up <em>price</em>. The battery tech was nowhere near ready, and per the Wikipedia article the estimated actual cost of the car was somewhere between $100,000 and $250,000 though I suspect it was much closer to the latter. It is interesting to note how much the owners (well, leasers) loved their EV1s. Having gone through that same conversion myself, I empathize!</p> <p>I then watched the sequel, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge_of_the_Electric_Car>Revenge of the Electric Car</a>. This one is essential, because it covers the dawn of the modern electric car we have today.</p> <iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/jkRIu5a6Sb0 frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>This chronicles the creation of three very influential early electric cars ‚Äî the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Leaf>Nissan Leaf</a>, the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Volt>Chevy Volt</a>, and of course the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster_(2008)>Tesla Roadster</a> from 2005 - 2008. The precise moment that Lithium-Ion batteries were in play ‚Äì that's when electric cars started to become viable. Every one of these three electric cars was well conceived and made it to market in volume, though not without significant challenges, both internal and external. None of them were perfect electric vehicles by any means: the Roadster was $100k, the Leaf had limited range, and the Volt was still technically a hybrid, albeit only using the gasoline engine to charge the battery.</p> <p>Ten years later, Tesla has the model 3 at $38,000 and we bought our Kia Niro for about the same price. After national and state tax incentives and rebates, that puts the price at around $30,000. It's not as cheap as it needs to be ‚Ä¶ yet. But it's getting there. And it's <a href=https://www.corporateknights.com/channels/clean-technology/faceoff-electric-vs-gas-cars-on-cost-15555966/>already competitive with gasoline vehicles in 2019</a>.</p> <p><img src=https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/08/2019-civic-vs-leaf-1.jpg alt=2019-civic-vs-leaf-1 loading=lazy></p> <p>It's still early, but the trend lines are clear. And I'm here to tell you that right now, today, I'd buy <em>any</em> modern electric car over a gasoline powered car.</p> <iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/kk7ZTn9g7bY frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>If you too are intrigued by the idea of owning an electric car, <em>you should be</em>. It's freaking awesome! Bring your skepticism, as always; I highly recommend the above Matt Ferrell explainer video on electric vehicle myths.</p> <p>As for me, I have seen the future, and it is absolutely, inexorably, and unavoidably ‚Ä¶ electric. ‚ö°</p>  <b><a href=//blog.codinghorror.com/electric-geek-transportation-systems/#discourse-comments>Discussion</a></b> </section> </article> <nav class=pagination> <span class=page-number>Page 1 of 286</span> <a class=older-posts href=/page/2/>Older Posts <span aria-hidden=true>‚Üí</span></a> </nav> </main> <script>var discourseUrl = "https://discourse.codinghorror.com/";
