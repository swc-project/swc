// Each element expression in a non-empty array literal is processed as follows:
//    - If the array literal contains no spread elements, and if the array literal is contextually typed (section 4.19)
//      by a type T and T has a property with the numeric name N, where N is the index of the element expression in the array literal,
//      the element expression is contextually typed by the type of that property.
// The resulting type an array literal expression is determined as follows:
//     - If the array literal contains no spread elements and is contextually typed by a tuple-like type,
//       the resulting type is a tuple type constructed from the types of the element expressions.
