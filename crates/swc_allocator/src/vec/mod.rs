    ///
    /// This is highly unsafe, due to the number of invariants that aren't
    /// checked:
    ///
    /// * `ptr` must have been allocated using the global allocator, such as via
    ///   the [`alloc::alloc`] function.
    /// * `T` needs to have the same alignment as what `ptr` was allocated with.
    ///   (`T` having a less strict alignment is not sufficient, the alignment
    ///   really needs to be equal to satisfy the [`dealloc`] requirement that
    ///   memory must be allocated and deallocated with the same layout.)
    /// * The size of `T` times the `capacity` (ie. the allocated size in bytes)
    ///   needs to be the same size as the pointer was allocated with. (Because
    ///   similar to alignment, [`dealloc`] must be called with the same layout
    ///   `size`.)
    /// * `length` needs to be less than or equal to `capacity`.
    /// * The first `length` values must be properly initialized values of type
    ///   `T`.
    /// * `capacity` needs to be the capacity that the pointer was allocated
    ///   with.
    /// * The allocated size in bytes must be no larger than `isize::MAX`. See
    ///   the safety documentation of [`pointer::offset`].
    ///
    /// These requirements are always upheld by any `ptr` that has been
    /// allocated via `Vec<T>`. Other allocation sources are allowed if the
    /// invariants are upheld.
    ///
    /// Violating these may cause problems like corrupting the allocator's
    /// internal data structures. For example it is normally **not** safe
    /// to build a `Vec<u8>` from a pointer to a C `char` array with length
    /// `size_t`, doing so is only safe if the array was initially allocated by
    /// a `Vec` or `String`.
    /// It's also not safe to build one from a `Vec<u16>` and its length,
    /// because the allocator cares about the alignment, and these two types
    /// have different alignments. The buffer was allocated with alignment 2
    /// (for `u16`), but after turning it into a `Vec<u8>` it'll be
    /// deallocated with alignment 1. To avoid these issues, it is often
    /// preferable to do casting/transmuting using [`slice::from_raw_parts`]
    /// instead.
    ///
    /// The ownership of `ptr` is effectively transferred to the
    /// `Vec<T>` which may then deallocate, reallocate or change the
    /// contents of memory pointed to by the pointer at will. Ensure
    /// that nothing else uses the pointer after calling this
    /// function.
