### Instructions

-   You can run execution tests by doing `./scripts/exec.sh` to see if your changes are working.
-   If an execution test fails, you are wrong.
-   Always run execution tests after making changes.
-   You can run fixture tests by doing `./scripts/test.sh`, and you can do `UPDATE=1 ./scripts/test.sh` to update fixtures.
