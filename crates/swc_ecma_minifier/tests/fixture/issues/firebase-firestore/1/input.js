                 *
                 * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only
                 * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of
                 * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence
                 * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see
                 * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from
                 * persistence.
                 *
                 * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary
                 * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as
                 * the addition of new mutations and query targets.
                 *
                 * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary
                 * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent
                 * operations will automatically fail.
                 *
                 * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the
                 * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make
                 * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary
                 * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload
                 * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the
                 * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a "zombiedClient" entry in
                 * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and
                 * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.
                 *
                 * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no
                 * longer optional.

                 * A PersistentStream is an abstract base class that represents a streaming RPC
                 * to the Firestore backend. It's built on top of the connections own support
                 * for streaming RPCs, and adds several critical features for our clients:
                 *
                 *   - Exponential backoff on failure
                 *   - Authentication via CredentialsProvider
                 *   - Dispatching all callbacks into the shared worker queue
                 *   - Closing idle streams after 60 seconds of inactivity
                 *
                 * Subclasses of PersistentStream implement serialization of models to and
                 * from the JSON representation of the protocol buffers for a specific
                 * streaming RPC.
                 *
                 * ## Starting and Stopping
                 *
                 * Streaming RPCs are stateful and need to be start()ed before messages can
                 * be sent and received. The PersistentStream will call the onOpen() function
                 * of the listener once the stream is ready to accept requests.
                 *
                 * Should a start() fail, PersistentStream will call the registered onClose()
                 * listener with a FirestoreError indicating what went wrong.
                 *
                 * A PersistentStream can be started and stopped repeatedly.
