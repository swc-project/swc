## swc_plugin (PUBLIC INTERFACE DEPRECATED)

Provides internal implementation detail to communicate between `@swc/core` to the plugin.

NOTE: This was previously entrypoint sdk to authoring a plugin, but `swc_core` becomes a meta entrypoint to any features SWC provides (https://github.com/swc-project/swc/discussions/5244).
