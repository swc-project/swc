/**
 * pooledMap transforms values from an (async) iterable into another async
 * iterable. The transforms are done concurrently, with a max concurrency
 * defined by the poolLimit.
 *
 * If an error is thrown from `iterableFn`, no new transformations will begin.
 * All currently executing transformations are allowed to finish and still
 * yielded on success. After that, the rejections among them are gathered and
 * thrown by the iterator in an `AggregateError`.
 *
 * @param poolLimit The maximum count of items being processed concurrently.
 * @param array The input array for mapping.
 * @param iteratorFn The function to call for every item of the array.
