/// *before* we convert to an iterator, we can also **split** it at a
/// particular point using the `split_at` method. This will yield up
/// two producers, one producing the items before that point, and one
/// producing the items after that point (these two producers can then
/// independently be split further, or be converted into iterators).
/// In Rayon, this splitting is used to divide between threads.
/// See [the `plumbing` README][r] for further details.
///
/// Note that each producer will always produce a fixed number of
/// items N. However, this number N is not queryable through the API;
/// the consumer is expected to track it.
