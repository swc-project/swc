/// Conversion trait to convert an `Iterator` to a `ParallelIterator`.
///
/// This creates a "bridge" from a sequential iterator to a parallel one, by distributing its items
/// across the Rayon thread pool. This has the advantage of being able to parallelize just about
/// anything, but the resulting `ParallelIterator` can be less efficient than if you started with
/// `par_iter` instead. However, it can still be useful for iterators that are difficult to
/// parallelize by other means, like channels or file or network I/O.
///
/// Iterator items are pulled by `next()` one at a time, synchronized from each thread that is
/// ready for work, so this may become a bottleneck if the serial iterator can't keep up with the
/// parallel demand. The items are not buffered by `IterBridge`, so it's fine to use this with
/// large or even unbounded iterators.
///
/// The resulting iterator is not guaranteed to keep the order of the original iterator.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// To use this trait, take an existing `Iterator` and call `par_bridge` on it. After that, you can
/// use any of the `ParallelIterator` methods:
///
/// ```
/// use rayon::iter::ParallelBridge;
/// use rayon::prelude::ParallelIterator;
/// use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
///
/// let rx = {
///     let (tx, rx) = channel();
///
///     tx.send("one!");
///     tx.send("two!");
///     tx.send("three!");
///
///     rx
/// };
///
/// let mut output: Vec<&'static str> = rx.into_iter().par_bridge().collect();
/// output.sort_unstable();
///
/// assert_eq!(&*output, &["one!", "three!", "two!"]);
/// ```
